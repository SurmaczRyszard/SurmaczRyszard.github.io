This was my bachelor's thesis with a title of \"Design of a small wind tunnel for laboratory experiments.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n\n  <p>\n    It was an interesting challenge. As the name suggests, the goal was to design a wind tunnel for a university. The goal was to observe the influence of dimples on a golf ball and compare it with a regular, smooth ball. This dictated the size and conditions in the test section.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The final design included settling chamber which stabilised the flow and prepared it for the test section after contraction, and then a fan a the end of a diffuser. The test section was designed to be made from acrylic sheets to be able to observe the sample from the desired angle.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.01.44.png\" height=\"1410\" width=\"2440\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.01.44-xs.png 384w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.01.44-sm.png 600w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.01.44-md.png 768w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.01.44-lg.png 1200w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.01.44-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The design was validated with the use of ANSYS Fluent and some of the results you can see below.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/vel.png\" height=\"516\" width=\"1080\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/vel-xs.png 384w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/vel-sm.png 600w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/vel-md.png 768w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/vel-lg.png 1200w ,https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/vel-xl.png 1600w\">\n      <figcaption>Velocity distribution on the symmetry plane</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"2\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/vel_test1.png\" data-size=\"1088x716\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/vel_test1-thumbnail.png\" height=\"505\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Velocity path lines in the test section</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/vel_test_2.png\" data-size=\"378x452\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/1/gallery/vel_test_2-thumbnail.png\" height=\"452\" width=\"378\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Velocity distribution at the location of the test object</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

It was, of course, done by Jakub and I was helping with the electrical and technical part of the project.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As it was a prototype, it had to be created on budget. To do so, a bluetooth speaker was used, to which we connected to a Arduino Nano clone and step-down board to power. The Arduino was gathering signal sent to the speaker from its control board, and then, after analysis of the frequencies, triggered an electromagnet to create the visual effects with the ferrofluid. The circuit is shown below, together with the final results and some behind the scene look.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I also highly recommend to check out Jakub's <a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/jakubmasica\">ArtStation profile</a>, where you can see some of his amazing work.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_2684-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3024x4032\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_2684-2-thumbnail.jpg\" height=\"1024\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/main-2.jpg\" data-size=\"2160x2147\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/main-2-thumbnail.jpg\" height=\"763\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0303-1-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4032x3024\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0303-1-2-thumbnail.JPG\" height=\"576\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.23.14-2.png\" data-size=\"2436x1640\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-22.23.14-2-thumbnail.png\" height=\"517\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>",

This time, it was done in cooperation with COMMON S.A. which is a producer of high quality equipment for gas measurement systems.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n\n  <p>\n    The goal was to design a simple injection system to lubricate the bearing inside a working flow meter. It was interesting due to the high pressure inside the device that had to be overcome during application.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I was a member of a team with 4 of my colleagues. After brainstorming, our approach was to utilise a screw and a nut design, which would apply a specific amount of oil during its movement. As I have mentioned before, the pressure inside was very high, in fact it was 110 bars. Thanks to proper design the worker does not need to apply large force and thanks to usage of the industrial valve, the pressure will not cause the oil leak into to reservoir.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This event was an amazing opportunity to test our knowledge with a time limit. It was a thorough effort, from brainstorming and ideation to the final model, incorporating analysis, calculations, and market research.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-4.png\" data-size=\"638x518\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-4-thumbnail.png\" height=\"518\" width=\"638\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-1.png\" data-size=\"612x542\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-1-thumbnail.png\" height=\"542\" width=\"612\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-2.png\" data-size=\"830x528\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-2-thumbnail.png\" height=\"489\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-3.png\" data-size=\"932x580\">\n        <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://surmaczryszard.github.io/media/posts/5/gallery/Picture-3-thumbnail.png\" height=\"478\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>",
