  <p>
    This was one of the most interesting projects I have ever worked on. This was my bachelor's thesis with a title of "Design of a small wind tunnel for laboratory experiments.&nbsp;
  </p>


  <p>
    It was an interesting challenge. As the name suggests, the goal was to design a wind tunnel for a university. The goal was to observe the influence of dimples on a golf ball and compare it with a regular, smooth ball. This dictated the size and conditions in the test section.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    The final design included settling chamber which stabilised the flow and prepared it for the test section after contraction, and then a fan a the end of a diffuser. The test section was designed to be made from acrylic sheets to be able to observe the sample from the desired angle.

  </p>


  <p>
    The The design was done in a retrofuturistic style which was the main focus of the whole work of the diploma. It was, of course, done by Jakub and I was helping with the electrical and technical part of the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    As it was a prototype, it had to be created on budget. To do so, a bluetooth speaker was used, to which we connected to a Arduino Nano clone and step-down board to power. The Arduino was gathering signal sent to the speaker from its control board, and then, after analysis of the frequencies, triggered an electromagnet to create the visual effects with the ferrofluid. The circuit is shown below, together with the final results and some behind the scene look.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also highly recommend to check out Jakub's <a href="https://www.artstation.com/jakubmasica">ArtStation profile</a>, where you can see some of his amazing work.

    In December of 2024, I took part in a MECHATON, which is a 48-hour engineering challenge organised by Lodz University of Technology. This time, it was done in cooperation with COMMON S.A. which is a producer of high quality equipment for gas measurement systems.&nbsp;

  </p>


  <p>
    The goal was to design a simple injection system to lubricate the bearing inside a working flow meter. It was interesting due to the high pressure inside the device that had to be overcome during application.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    I was a member of a team with 4 of my colleagues. After brainstorming, our approach was to utilise a screw and a nut design, which would apply a specific amount of oil during its movement. As I have mentioned before, the pressure inside was very high, in fact it was 110 bars. Thanks to proper design the worker does not need to apply large force and thanks to usage of the industrial valve, the pressure will not cause the oil leak into to reservoir.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    This event was an amazing opportunity to test our knowledge with a time limit. It was a thorough effort, from brainstorming and ideation to the final model, incorporating analysis, calculations, and market research.

  </p>


  <p>
    THOur team went as 4 mechanical engineers, trying their skills in this multidisciplinary challenge. Having the most experience with programming and Arduino, I was responsible for creating software which controlled the car. It was a perfect opportunity to put my skills from previous projects into use.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    The resultant vehicle, although not the prettiest, was able to get through the course without problems. Unfortunately, we have placed just before the podium, but it was still an amazing opportunity to try ourselves in an area that is unfamiliar to our skillset, and I would love to attend the next instalment of the event.
